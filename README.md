# ScaleBFM

The official implementation of *Scaling Behavior Foundation Model for Humanoid Robots*.

> ScaleBFM investigates how Behavior Foundation Models can be effectively scaled
> through the coordinated design of the learning paradigm, behavioral data, and
> model architecture. The resulting framework enables humanoid robots to perform
> diverse behaviors with natural whole-body coordination, including agile
> locomotion, dexterous manipulation, and coordinated loco-manipulation in both
> simulation and the real world.

## ScaleRetarget

**ScaleRetarget** is the motion-retargeting toolkit used to prepare human motion
data for ScaleBFM. It converts motion from common mocap representations into
robot joint trajectories and currently provides a complete configuration for the
Unitree G1 humanoid.


The retargeting code and documentation are available in
**[ScaleRetarget](ScaleRetarget/README.md)**. See the guide for supported datasets,
environment setup, motion retargeting, dataset preparation, and visualization.

## ScaleTrack

**ScaleTrack** provides the foundational implementation of the BFM pretraining
pipeline. It packages retargeted robot trajectories into motion datasets and
pretrains BFMs through motion tracking in IsaacLab using the bundled RSL-RL
implementation. It currently provides a complete pretraining pipeline for the
Unitree G1 humanoid, including single- and multi-GPU training, policy playback, and export.

The training code and documentation are available in
**[ScaleTrack](ScaleTrack/README.md)**. See the guide for environment and robot
asset setup, motion preparation and packaging, policy training, playback, and
export.

## ScaleBridge

**ScaleBridge** provides a unified Sim2Sim and Sim2Real deployment framework for
Behavior Foundation Models on humanoid robots. It enables a seamless transition
from policy evaluation in MuJoCo to deployment on physical robots.

The deployment code and documentation are available in
**[ScaleBridge](ScaleBridge/README.md)**. See the guide for environment setup,
robot controller configuration, policy evaluation, real-world deployment, and
migration instructions.
